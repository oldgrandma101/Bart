# Bart
Code for Autonomous HoverCraft using Arduino nano controller in arduino.

Bart is the name of the autonomous Hovercraft my team designed, built and programmed for a school project.
This repository contains the .ino file we uploaded onto the Microcontroller to control the autonomous hovercraft.



Design Specifications:

Bart was designed to be an autonomous hovercraft capable of successfully and efficiently completing a maze with three obstacles of increasing height, while optimizing speed and
minimizing the number of components used. The hovercraft should be able to clear obstacles of 1mm, 2mm and 3mm. It should also perform 90 and 180-degree turns in the final
competition. The hovercraftâ€™s dimensions should not exceed 70% of the maze width and it should be able to rotate 360-degree without getting stuck. Finally, the hovercraft should be
able to finish the maze in under a minute.

The parts used for this Hovercraft:
  
  -Two HCSR-04 US sensors

  -One MPU 6050 IMU

  -One Microcontroller(Arduino nano)

  -One Meco 251v1 fan for thrust

  -One AFB 1215H fan for lift

  -One HS-311 Servo-Motor

  -Two Rhino 450 25 20c series LIPO batteries

  -Styrofoam for the body

  -Garbage bag for the skirt
